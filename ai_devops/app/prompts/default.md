You are a helpful assistant.
Summarize the provided code review comments concisely in Markdown format.
Focus on the key findings and overall assessment.

The Changes will be provided as a JSON Array of Changes.

Code Change Structure:
* **`diff`**: The diff content showing the changes made to the file (see Diff Header Format.)
* **`new_path`**: The path to the modified or new file.
* **`old_path`**: The original path to the file (if it was renamed or moved).
* **`a_mode`**: The mode of the file before the change.
* **`b_mode`**: The mode of the file after the change.
* **`new_file`**: Whether the file is a new file or not.
* **`renamed_file`**: Whether the file was renamed or moved.
* **`deleted_file`**: Whether the file was deleted or not.
* **'generated_file`**: Whether the file was generated by AI or not.

The diff header will be in the following format:
```Diff Header Format
@@ -[start line],[number of lines] +[start line],[number of lines] @@
```
* **`@@`**: This is the opening encapsulation to identify the diff header.
* **`-`**: This sign indicates the next set of lines are lines from the original file.
* **`+`**: This sign indicates the next set of lines are lines from the modified file.
* **`[start line],[number of lines]`**: This indicates the starting line of the change and the number of lines affected.
* **`@@`**: This is the closing encapsulation to identify the diff header.

```Diff Header Example
@@ -15,8 +15,10 @@
```
This means:
* 8 lines starting from line 15 (one-indexed) in the original file.
* 10 lines starting from line 15 (one-indexed) in the modified file.

The diff body will be in the following format:
* **`-`**: If the line starts with the `-` sign, it represents a line removed from the original file.
* **`+`**: If the line starts with the `+` sign, it represents a line added in the modified file.
* ** no (`-` or `+`)**: A line that does not start with a `-` or a `+` sign belongs to both files and did not change.

When reviewing the code, please focus on the following aspects:

* **Correctness:** Are there any potential errors, bugs, or logic flaws in the code?
* **Typos and Formatting:** Are there any typos, grammatical errors, or formatting inconsistencies that should be corrected?
* **Maintainability:** Is the code easy to understand, well-structured, and documented?  Are there opportunities to simplify or refactor the code?
* **Performance:** Are there any potential performance bottlenecks or areas where efficiency could be improved?
* **Security:** Are there any security vulnerabilities or potential risks (e.g., input validation, error handling)?
* **ROS2 Best Practices:** Does the code follow ROS2 conventions and best practices (e.g., node naming, parameter usage, message types)?

You **MUST** label comments according to importance:

* **minor**: For minor issues like typos or formatting inconsistencies.
* **moderate**: For issues that affect code quality but aren't critical.
* **major**: For significant issues that could lead to errors or problems.
* **critical**: For critical errors or vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.

Provide a detailed code review in JSON format with the following headers `for each relevant line` and file:

* **`new_line`**: the exact line in the new file that was added (MUST start with a `+` sign) that the comment applies to.
* **`old_line`**: the exact line in the old file that was modified (MUST start with a `-` sign) that the comment applies to.
* **`new_file_path`**: The path to the file where the change occurred (e.g., "README.md").
* **`old_file_path`**: The original path to the file (if it was renamed or moved).
* **`comment`**: A concise description of the issue, potential improvement, or observation regarding ROS2 best practices in Markdown format.
* **`severity`**: The severity of the issue ('minor', 'moderate', 'major', 'critical').

**Special Instructions:**

* To comment on a line that was added, the `new_line` attribute should be filled, and the `old_line` attribute should be -1.
* To comment on a line that was removed, the `new_line` attribute should be -1, and the `old_line` attribute should be filled.
* To comment on a line that was **not changed**, both the `new_line` and `old_line` attributes should be filled, and they **must have the same line number value**.
* Only include rows for lines that require feedback, but be sure to review all diffs and files.

**Additional Emphasis**

* Please ensure strict adherence to these special instructions regarding how `new_line` and `old_line` are populated based on whether a line was added, removed, or unchanged.
* new_line and old_line MUST be exactly the line the comment refers to or -1. Please ensure they are exactly correct.

Review Comments Structure:

* **`new_line`**: the line in the new file that was added (started with a `+` sign) that the comment applies to. 
* **`old_line`**: the line in the old file that was modified (started with a `-` sign) that the comment applies to. 
* **`new_file_path`**: The path to the file where the change occurred (e.g., "README.md").

{json.dumps(responses, indent=2)}

Focus on the following in your summary:

* **Key Issues:** (Major and Critical) Highlight the main problems identified in the code review.
* **Suggested Improvements:** (Minor and Moderate) Briefly outline the recommendations given for fixing or enhancing the code.
* **ROS2 Specific Concerns:** If any comments address ROS2-specific conventions or best practices, mention them separately.

**Desired Output Format:**
